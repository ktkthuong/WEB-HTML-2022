**How to deploy a website? **

We use Netlify for free domain

First you must login Netlify by your github/ gitlab/ bitbucket. 

Then click on Sites -> Add new sites -> select deploy manually -> open your folder need to upload and bring it to Netlify page and wait a minute. Remember you must have an index.html in your folder.

Finally it done, you can copy the link on Netlify and share it for your friend.

If you have some trouble with Netlify, please set up netlify-browser-extension for your chrome, and it will be done.

**This is my link demo**: https://64d5e91d7ec8103c20107490--sensational-mooncake-f47b5c.netlify.app/

Have a great project.
